# Nitro code editor.

Nitro editor is a free and open-source online code-editor developed by Void#0897 and Fakie#6027; For the  [Builder Groop S2 Hackathon](https://hacks.buildergroop.com). 

Nitro editor uses [React.js](https://reactjs.org) as the JavaScript framework used to build the website, [React-Ace](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-ace) as the implementation for the code editor, and [FileSaver.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/file-saver) for saving your code files, and finally we have implemented [hop](https://hop.io) for Realtime deployment. 

# Why Nitro-editor?

- Nitro editor is very basic and easy to use, unlike some alternatives that are complicated to learn.

- Nitro editor is fully online and requires no setup, plus can be accessed from anywhere *Requires no extensions for language support or themes*.

- Nitro currently has support for 8+ programming languages and if updated due to ace it could have support 		             for 45+ programming languages without the need for any extensions. 

- Again, due to ace editor; Nitro if updated can have support for 24+ themes to personalize your code editor to your liking.

- Nitro is **almost** fully reactive meaning you can code on the go! (*almost* depending on device and orientation can be fixed in the future with updates)

# If I had more time I would add:

- Multi-file support so you can edit multiple files at the same time.

- Realtime JavaScript console built into the site.

- Improved settings menu, such as font size, highlight active line, show line numbers, tab size, snippets, auto complete, etc.

# Where can I view the source code and or contact you?
